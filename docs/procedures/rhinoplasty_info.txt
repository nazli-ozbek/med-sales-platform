Rhinoplasty is a cosmetic surgical procedure aimed at reshaping the nose. It can be done for medical or aesthetic reasons. The operation typically lasts 1 to 2 hours and is performed under general anesthesia.

Patients may experience swelling and bruising after the surgery. Full recovery usually takes about 7 days. Potential risks include bleeding, infection, scarring, and dissatisfaction with cosmetic results.

It is important to follow post-operative care instructions provided by your doctor to ensure proper healing.
