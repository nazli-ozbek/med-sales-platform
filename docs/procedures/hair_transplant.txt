Hair transplant is a cosmetic surgical procedure aimed at restoring hair growth in areas affected by baldness. The most common methods include FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) and FUT (Follicular Unit Transplantation).

Typical recovery takes about 10-14 days, with full hair growth visible after several months.

Possible risks include infection, scarring, and uneven hair growth.

General anesthesia or local anesthesia is typically used.
