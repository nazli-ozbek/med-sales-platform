Liposuction is a cosmetic procedure that removes excess fat deposits from various parts of the body, including the abdomen, thighs, and arms.

Recovery usually takes 1-2 weeks, depending on the extent of the procedure.

Possible risks include infection, bleeding, asymmetry, and skin irregularities.

Local or general anesthesia may be applied.
